# Forecasting Bitcoin Prices with Time Series Analysis

## Introduction

Time series forecasting is a critical tool in financial markets, enabling predictions of future trends based on historical data. This project focuses on forecasting Bitcoin (BTC) prices, highlighting the significance of accurate predictions in managing investments and mitigating risks within the volatile cryptocurrency market.

## An Introduction to Time Series Forecasting

Time series forecasting involves analyzing sequential data to predict future outcomes. In finance, it's instrumental for anticipating stock prices, exchange rates, and commodities like Bitcoin. Accurate BTC price forecasts are invaluable due to the cryptocurrency's substantial influence on global financial dynamics and its notorious volatility.

## Preprocessing Method

To prepare our data for modeling, we undertook several preprocessing steps, including:

- **Normalization**: Scaling features to a uniform range (0 to 1) to ensure no single feature dominates during training.
- **Missing Value Handling**: Replacing missing values with the mean or median of the respective columns to maintain data integrity.

## Model Architecture

For this project, we employed a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, known for its capability to capture long-term dependencies in time series dataâ€”a key factor in BTC price forecasting. The model architecture comprises:

- **Input Layer**: Processes sequences of historical BTC prices.
- **LSTM Layers**: Extracts temporal patterns from the data.
- **Output Layer**: Generates predictions for the next BTC price.


## Results and Evaluation

Upon model training and evaluation, we assessed its performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), alongside visualizing predicted versus actual BTC prices. Insights from these results highlighted the model's ability to identify certain price movement patterns, despite the inherent complexities and uncertainties of the cryptocurrency market.

## Conclusion

Engaging in this forecasting endeavor offered both challenges and enriching experiences. While achieving perfect predictions remains elusive due to the unpredictable nature of Bitcoin prices, the project underscored the potential of time series analysis in uncovering underlying trends. Future enhancements could involve integrating more advanced models or external indicators to refine prediction accuracy.
